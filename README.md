# PredictionAssistantAnalyzerWeb

The goal of this project is to provide greater accessibility to PredictIt market data, specifically past market data, as well as analyzers to help the user interpret the data at a glance.

This also is a project I'm using to help me learn more Angular/Typescript/Node/etc without any guide to follow, so it is unlikely that it will be developed to a final commercial/production level state. There are several more features I'd like to introduce, like login/logout/userAccount for storing tracked markets and personal settings etc, but that wouldn't really be a learning opportunity for me and would be time spent on something that would never be used or useful to me. It may get done in the future though.
